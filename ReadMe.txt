   RAT - Relational Algebra Translator

   RAT allows you to convert nearly all relational algebra queries in one step to . Why would you want to do that? Well, the DivX Media Format can change the way you play,create and share digital video.

   Relational algebra is a query language that is being used to explain basic relational operations and their principles. Many books and articles are concerned with the theory of relational algebra; however, there are few available tools that allow the students to have hands on experience with the relational algebra queries. Most of the currently used relational database management systems work with SQL queries. This work therefore describes and implements a tool that transforms relational algebra expressions into SQL queries, allowing the expressions to be evaluated in standard databases. This also allows the user to integrate the queries to various DBMS engines and have direct interaction with the database using relational algebra queries.



| 2. System Requirements
+========================-

   PIV 1Ghz or better
   Linux OS 2.6 and higher
   20MB free space for application

   This is a beta version of the software. We will like to improve on this and want to create a full-proof software that will make the DBMS students' life a lot easier. :-) 
   Feel free to contact us at Mangesh Bendre <bendre1@illinois.edu>, Nilam Sharma <sharma30@illinois.edu> whenever you will find any bug (You may find many :-( ).

   RAT Parser uses GOLD Parser application to create the DFA grammer needed for parsing.

   RAT also uses the QT Framework for development of the FE application.


   Thank you for using RAT.
